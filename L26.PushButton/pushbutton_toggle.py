#create constants to represent piRover LED pin numbers

#create constant to represent the green, amber,and red timings for NS

#create constant to represent the green, amber,and red timings for EW

#create timing variables for green, amber, and red
green_delay = 0
amber_delay = 0
red_delay = 0 

# Configure GPIO setting

# Set specific pints as output

# Initialize all LEDs to OFF

# Welcome user and prompt for NS or EW simulation

# Check user's direction input. If valid then set light timing variables

# Use a while loop initially to test light cycles
# Implement for loop as time permits
